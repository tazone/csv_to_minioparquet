# csv_to_minioparquet
 This script is designed to process CSV files from a specified directory, convert them to Parquet format, and upload them to a bucket in MinIO. The process includes dynamic schema detection for CSV files, handling large files by reading in chunks, and parallel processing to improve performance. The script uses a checkpoint file, based on a combination of the file name and its MD5 checksum, to prevent uploading duplicates. Additionally, the script includes a retry mechanism for uploads in case of failure and logs all key operations and errors to a log file, enabling monitoring and troubleshooting.
